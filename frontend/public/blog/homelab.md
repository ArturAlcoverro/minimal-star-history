Homelab is a server that resides locally in one's home to host several applications and virtualized systems for testing, developing, home or functional usage.

Homelab isn't a necessity. However, it provides you with extra space of good privacy to experiment and develop with little cost.

## Vaultwarden

![Vaultwarden-star](/assets/blog/homelab/vaultwarden-star.webp)

[Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation that implements many of the Bitwarden APIs required for most functionality, ideal for self-hosted deployments where running the official resource-heavy service is undesirable.

Since the server only hosts encrypted data, it is quite secure. Resource consumption is low and works very well in teams and concurrent connections with docker.

## AdGuard

![AdGuardHome-star](/assets/blog/homelab/adguardhome-star.webp)

[AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking, covering ALL your home devices. It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.

To build AdGuard, you will need Go v1.23 or later, Node.js v18.18 or later, and npm v8 or later. You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. Once it's installed, the service is already started with no need to launch anything explicitly.

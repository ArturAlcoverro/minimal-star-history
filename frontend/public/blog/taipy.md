[**Taipy**](https://links.taipy.io/15J5bi7) is a fully open-source Python framework. It is a Two-in-One tool for UI generation and Scenario/Data Management. Use it to develop and deploy any Data & AI web application in no time within a single language: Python.

![WhatisTaipy.gif](/assets/blog/taipy/taipy.gif)

Taipy is designed for data scientists and machine learning engineers to build data & AI web applications.

⭐️ Enables building production-ready web applications.
⭐️ No need to learn new languages. Only Python is needed. No HTML, no CSS, no JS.
⭐️ Concentrate on Data and AI algorithms without development and deployment complexities.

## Key features:

- **Callback** - lets users automatically trigger custom actions following certain events or the completion of specific tasks. Callbacks allow our software to apply flexible, event-driven automation, which is great for interactive applications.
- **Scenario management -** allows for organizing and running different workflow configurations, complete with version control and automation. It also allows for comparing the results of multiple runs for a given analysis to see what works best.
- **Multi-user** - enable several users to work together on the same Taipy application, each with safe, private access to a version of the app that is theirs alone.
- **Long-running jobs** - allows long-running jobs to finish without impacting the system, ensuring performance remains steady across the board.

## **Some Application Examples**

Here are some examples of applications that you can create with Taipy:

- **Dashboards:** to visualize your data and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), charts, maps, and more. Help decision-makers understand the company's current status.
- P**redictive Machine Learning applications:** like fraud detection apps, sales forecasting for retail operations, or energy consumption forecasting to control costs.
- Image classification applications: such as detecting crop diseases or nutrient deficiencies in agriculture, or performing medical image analysis for disease detection.
- **LLM Chatbots for customer support:** data analysis, task assistant, documentation... Connect your chatbots to your preferred LLMs or use an in-house, local, quantized model. Use any part of your LLM stack, including RAG and vector databases. Taipy provides an excellent interface for your chatbot.
- And so many others…

## **Taipy for GUI**

**The GUI component of the Taipy is the major one**. With this sub-library, you can create all kinds of data applications. Here are some things you can do with it:

- You can add controllers like buttons, gliders, or input forms. You can link them to Python variables and make those variables change as the user interacts through the GUI.
- You can change the style of your application to make it more appealing or add your corporate style.
- You can arrange the elements in columns, create multiple-page applications, and add visual elements like charts or maps...

You can create Taipy applications in 3 main ways:

- The Taipy application builder provides a set of Python functions for building apps through its API.
- With a special Markdown templating syntax.
- With an HTML template syntax.

## **Taipy for Scenario Management**

**Taipy Scenario Management** is the backend part of Taipy applications. You can create complete applications without it, but it offers a **convenient and declarative** way to abstract the data inputs, outputs, and function calls of your application, through configuration files. This way of creating pipelines makes it **easy to switch your application from a test environment to a production environment.**

On top of these, Taipy Scenario Management also offers methods to **orchestrate your data. This is one of the features that makes Taipy different and suited for production environments**, where you want your applications to live, using updated data and with minimal manual intervention.

You can achieve the following with Taipy Scenario Management:

- **Data Integration:** connect to any data source and keep track of its change using the same API for each data source…
- **Task Orchestration:** you can orchestrate tasks in Taipy, use your data to generate all the content for your applications…
- **Define Scenarios:** Track your data and KPIs over time
- **What-if analysis:** change the input parameters of your tasks to create different solutions and scenarios...

This gives you a visual representation of your pipelines. You can even use the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) as part of your project documentation!

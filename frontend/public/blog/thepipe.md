[**thepi.pe**](https://thepi.pe/) is an open-source package for intelligent document scraping at scale using vision-language models (VLMs). It works for dozens of file types. Unlike traditional scrapers, thepi.pe has no problems with poorly scanned PDFs, highly complex visuals, and irregularly formatted tables. It's designed to work with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and it integrates easily with LLM APIs, vector databases, and RAG frameworks.

## How it works

thepi.pe uses a combination of computer vision models and carefully crafted heuristics to extract clean content from various sources. It processes this content for downstream use with language models or vision transformers.

The output from thepi.pe is a list of chunks containing all content within the source document. These chunks can be easily converted to a prompt format compatible with any LLM or multimodal model using `thepipe.core.chunks_to_messages`.

## Key Features

1. **Multimodal Extraction**: Extract clean markdown, tables, and images from documents or webpages.
2. **Structured Data Extraction**: Extract structured data as JSON or CSV from any document or webpage.
3. **VLM-based Document Analysis**: Utilizes AI for filetype detection, layout analysis, and data extraction.
4. **Wide Format Support**: Works with PDFs, word docs, powerpoints, webpages, videos, images, and more.
5. **LLM Integration**: Seamlessly interfaces with any language model (GPT4, Claude, LLaMa) and vector databases like LlamaIndex.

## Getting Started

Install thepi.pe:

```bash
pip install thepipe-api
```

Here's a quick example of how to use thepi.pe with the hosted API:

```python
from thepipe.scraper import scrape_file
from thepipe.core import chunks_to_messages
from openai import OpenAI

# Scrape markdown, tables, visuals
chunks = scrape_file(filepath="paper.pdf", ai_extraction=True)

# Call LLM with clean, comprehensive data
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=chunks_to_messages(chunks),
)
```

## Supported File Types

thepi.pe supports a wide range of file types, including:

- Webpages (URLs)
- PDFs
- Word Documents
- PowerPoint Presentations
- Videos and Audio files
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Spreadsheets
- Images

And it's easily extensible to support any custom file type of your choice.

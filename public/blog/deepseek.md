Recently, DeepSeek has gone viral and broken into the mainstream for its Enhanced contextual understanding, improved response accuracy and advanced learning capabilities.

Lots of open-source projects have integrated DeepSeek to enhance their capabilities in natural language processing, streamline user interactions, and deliver more intelligent, context-aware solutions. Among them are some out-standing projects as follows:

-   [Dify](#dify)
-   [PapersGPT For Zotero](#papersgpt-for-zotero)
-   [RagFlow](#ragflow)
-   [Solana Agent Kit](#solana-agent-kit)

## Dify

PapersGPT has further enhanced its intelligent paper summarization, cross-lingual document translation, and citation suggestion generation features by integrating DeepSeek. After comparing the performance of various large language models (LLMs) in its [Quick Start Guide](https://www.papersgpt.com/blogs/cookbook-papersgpt), PapersGPT strongly recommends that users opt for the DeepSeek integration when utilizing PapersGPT.

## RagFlow

[RagFlow](https://ragflow.io/) is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine based on deep document understanding. It offers a streamlined RAG workflow for businesses of any scale, combining LLM to provide truthful question-answering capabilities, backed by well-founded citations from various complex formatted data.

You can configure DeepSeek following RAGFlow's [Quick Start](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/#configure-llms) document. DeepSeek serves as the core of the language model, offering robust capabilities in text comprehension and generation. RAGFlow enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation by integrating with vector databases (such as Elasticsearch) for efficient retrieval. It combines the retrieved relevant document fragments with the language model to produce more accurate responses.

## Solana Agent Kit

SendAI is the AI development lab and community focused on the Solana ecosystem, aiming to amplify Solana AI's capabilities a hundredfold. On January 28, 2025, SendAI [announced via X](https://x.com/sendaifun/status/1884232169872392632) their integration of DeepSeek, expressing confidence that this collaboration would enable the unlocking of myriad use cases at reduced costs, all while maintaining an open-source commitment.

## Lastly

The aforementioned tools had already been excellent examples in their respective fields, with some even garnering tens of thousands of stars on GitHub within a single year. Now, with the assistance of DeepSeek, their performance will be further enhanced, delivering an even more astonishing user experience.

Let's look forward to it.

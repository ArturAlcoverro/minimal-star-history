Obsidian is highly customizable with a strong user community ecosystem, offering a wide range of community-developed plugins and themes to tailor the app to different workflows. It supports features like backlinks, tags, and transclusion, enabling users to structure information in a non-linear, interconnected way. Aiming to be a "second brain" of its users, Obsidian was among the first ever to propose the concept of bidirectional linking and a graph view of notes and their connections that can be really complicated like a brain. Offline-first by design, Obsidian ensures your data remains private and accessible without relying on the cloud, although syncing options are available for those who need them.

However, Obsidian is not open-sourced, and the repo on GitHub does not contain the source code. For this sake, Logseq is widely considered as its open-source alternative.

Homelab is a server that resides locally in one's home to host several applications and virtualized systems for testing, developing, home or functional usage.

Homelab isn't a necessity. However, it provides you with extra space of good privacy to experiment and develop with little cost.

## Vaultwarden

[Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation that implements many of the Bitwarden APIs required for most functionality, ideal for self-hosted deployments where running the official resource-heavy service is undesirable.

Since the server only hosts encrypted data, it is quite secure. Resource consumption is low and works very well in teams and concurrent connections with docker.

## AdGuardHome

![AdGuardHome-star](/assets/blog/homelab/adguardhome-star.webp)

[AdGuardHome](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking, covering ALL your home devices. It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.

![AdGuardHome](/assets/blog/homelab/adguardhome.webp)

To build AdGuard Home, you will need Go v1.23 or later, Node.js v18.18 or later, and npm v8 or later. You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports. Once it's installed, the service is already started with no need to launch anything explicitly.

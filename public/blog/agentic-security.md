[**Agentic Security**](https://agentic-security.vercel.app/) is an open-source vulnerability scanner designed to protect **Agent Workflows** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from jailbreaks, fuzzing, and multimodal attacks. Built for developers, researchers, and security teams, Agentic Security empowers you to **proactively identify and mitigate risks** in AI systems—all within a lightweight, Python-based framework.

Agentic Security is **Apache 2.0-licensed** on GitHub and has already sparked interest in the **AI security community**. Whether you’re securing LLMs or stress-testing APIs, this tool is your go-to for **building safer, more reliable AI deployments**.

---

## 🚨 The Problem: AI Systems Are Vulnerable

As **AI adoption skyrockets, so do the threats**. LLMs face sophisticated attacks:

- **Jailbreaks** that bypass safety guardrails
- **Fuzzing** that exposes edge cases
- **Multimodal exploits** via text, images, or audio

Traditional security tools **aren’t equipped** to handle these risks, leaving **AI systems exposed**. We built **Agentic Security** to **address this gap** after encountering these challenges firsthand in **real-world deployments**.

---

## 🛡️ The Solution: Comprehensive AI Security Testing

Agentic Security brings **cutting-edge tools** to **safeguard your LLMs and agent workflows**:

### 🔍 **Multimodal Attacks** 🖼️🎙️
Test vulnerabilities across **text, images, and audio inputs**.

### 🌀 **Multi-Step Jailbreaks**
Simulate **iterative attack sequences** to uncover **hidden weaknesses**.

### 🧪 **Comprehensive Fuzzing**
Stress-test with **randomized inputs** to catch **unexpected behaviors**.

### 🌐 **API Stress Testing**
Push LLM APIs to their limits with **real-world attack scenarios**.

### 📡 **RL-Based Attacks**
Use **reinforcement learning** to evolve **adaptive probes** against your defenses.

With **seamless CI/CD integration** and a **user-friendly UI**, Agentic Security makes it **easy to secure AI at scale**.

## 🚀 Why Agentic Security?

✔️ **Open Source:** Freely extendable under **Apache 2.0**.

✔️ **Python-Powered:** No need to juggle languages—just **pure Python**.

✔️ **Scalable:** Handles **thousands of probes efficiently** with minimal setup.

✔️ **CI/CD Ready:** Integrates into **GitHub Actions** for automated scans.

When we **stress-tested an internal LLM** with Agentic Security, we identified a **24.8% failure rate on jailbreak attempts**—well within our **30% threshold**—and **patched it fast**. Now, we’re **sharing this power with you**.

## ⚡ Getting Started

Install Agentic Security with one command:

```bash
pip install agentic_security
```

Launch it:

```bash
agentic_security --port=8718 --host=0.0.0.0
```

Or run it as a CI check:

```bash
agentic_security ci
```

See the Quick Start guide for more.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge sources. It helps overcome limitations such as knowledge cutoff dates and reduces the risk of hallucinations in LLM outputs.

RAG works by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using it to augment the LLMâ€™s input, allowing the model to generate more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.

For this edition, we'll present some well-featured open-source RAG frameworks that represent the cutting edge of RAG technology and are worth investigating.

[Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) is an end-to-end LLM framework that allows you to build applications powered by LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more. Whether you want to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), document search, question answering or answer generation, Haystack can orchestrate state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs into pipelines to build end-to-end NLP applications and solve your use case.

Haystack supports multiple installation methods including Docker images. You can simply get Haystack via pip.

### Faceswap

[Faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos. The machine learning model primarily processes faces, and other objects might not work.

Powered by Tensorflow, Keras and Python; Faceswap will run on Windows, macOS and Linux. It insists on ethical and legal uses.

### Phaser

[Phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser) is a game framework based on HTML5, easy to integrate with modern web technologies, suitable for rapid iteration and deployment of web platforms as well. It is relatively lightweight and focuses more on browser-side game development.

Phaser offers WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. It is available via GitHub, npm and CDNs. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native apps by using 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.

Cooperating with Rosebud AI since 5th January 2024, Phaser's latest game templates revolve around AI Characters & NPCs. These templates allow game devs to create dynamic, interactive characters and integrate them into their games to reach a new level of depth and engagement. You can check out more trending projects on [play.rosebud.ai](https://play.rosebud.ai/) where all 2D games are run on Phaser, and clone any of them.

### Bark

![bark-star](/assets/blog/ai-generators/bark-star.webp)

[Bark](https://github.com/serp-ai/bark-with-voice-clone) supports various languages out-of-the-box and automatically determines language from input text. It can generate all types of audio and doesn't see a difference between speech and music. Bark has the capability to fully clone voices. You can provide certain speaker prompts such as NARRATOR, MAN, WOMAN, etc.

Bark has been tested and works on both CPU and GPU (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 11.7 and 12.0). Running Bark requires running >100M parameter transformer models. On modern GPUs and PyTorch nightly, Bark can generate audio in roughly realtime. On older GPUs, default colab, or CPU, inference time might be 10-100x slower.
